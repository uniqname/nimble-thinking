    <p>[The] product owner is typically a project's key stakeholder. Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the ... team. This is key to successfully starting any agile software development project. The agile product owner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product...</p>

    <p>In return for the Scrum team's commitment to completing the selected user stories from the top of the product backlog, the product owner makes a reciprocal commitment to not throw new requirements at the team during the sprint. Requirements are allowed to change (and change is encouraged) but only outside the sprint. Once the team starts on a sprint, it remains maniacally focused on the goal of that sprint.</p>

  <blockquote class="aside">
    <p>[A]n epic failure at the end of a long cycle (6, 9, 12 months) is frowned upon... as it should be. Accordingly, this is the dig on the waterfall approach to developing software. At the end of the 12-month project, we may think we got it all right. We may have even worked double-time at the end to get there. But when the day comes to go live, we discover that what we created doesn’t work like it should, isn’t quite what the customer asked for 12 months ago, or the market has changed — and this thing we spent so much time creating is no longer valuable.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>If we failed in agile, we failed at the 2-week mark, not at 12 months.</p>
